What did Ptolomey believe was Jupiter\u2019s influence?\n\n> \u201cJupiter, if he should be lord alone, will thoroughly improve and benefit all things. Among mankind, in particular, this planet promotes honour, happiness, content, and peace, by augmenting all the necessaries and comforts of life, and all mental and bodily advantages. It induces also favours, benefits, and gifts emanating from royalty, and adds greater lustre to kings themselves, increasing their dignity and magnanimity: all men, in short, will share in the prosperity created by its influence. With regard to the operation of the event on brutes, those which are domestic and adapted to man&#8217;s service will be multiplied and will thrive; while others, which are useless and hostile to man, will be destroyed. The constitution of the atmosphere will be healthy and temperate, filled with gentle breezes and moisture, and favourable to fruits. Navigation will be safe and successful; rivers will rise to their just proportion; fruit and grain, and all other productions of the earth conducive to the welfare and happiness of mankind, will be presented in abundance.\u201d\n\nFrom Ptolomey\u2019s _Tetrabiblos,_\u00a0Book the Second: Chapter IX: The Quality and Nature of the Effect translated by J.M. Ashmand (London, Davis and Dickson: 1822), in the public domain.",

By the time astronomers discovered the comet in 1993, it had already been ensnared by Jupiter\u2019s intense gravity and broken up; in fact, it\u2019s likely that the comet had been orbiting Jupiter for several decades. Pieces of the comet crashed into Jupiter in July 1994, making big headlines. The Cure used the celestial smash-up as a romantic metaphor in their song:\n\n> &#8220;Meanwhile millions of miles away in space\n  \n> The incoming comet brushes Jupiter\u2019s face\n  \n> And disappears away with barely a trace&#8221;\n\n(Composed by Jason Toop Cooper, Perry Bamonte, Robert James Smith, Roger O&#8217;Donnell, Simon Gallup; Universal Music Publishing Group: 1996).\u00a0<a href=\"https:\/\/www.youtube.com\/watch?v=8dAdIqImoZw\" target=\"_blank\">Click here to listen.<\/a>",
