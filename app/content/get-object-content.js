      title: 'Whistle while you orbit',
      content:
        'During Voyager 1&#8217;s legendary flyby of Jupiter in March 1979, scientists were eager to study the gas giant&#8217;s tenuous magnetosphere, and trained the space probe&#8217;s instruments on it. While observing the magnetosphere, Voyager 1 detected that Jupiter was producing large amounts of radio waves, and duly began recording them for posterity. Among the sounds of Jupiter scientists heard were bizarre low-frequency descending tones whose origin was a mystery. Soon however, it was noted that the tones resembled a known phenomena &#8211; but on Earth. Dubbed &#8220;whistlers&#8221;, these descending radio signals, when recorded here, were produced by lightning strikes. Voyager 1 had inadvertently discovered lightning flashes on Jupiter, the first ever observation of lightning on another planet! Voyager 2, following behind Voyager 1, recorded whistlers at Jupiter as well, and confirmed the incredible discovery. Of course, lightning on Jupiter is far more impressive, with lightning flashes millions of times more powerful than that on Earth, but generating ghostly whistles all the same! Jupiter may lack life, but it is far from silent&#8230;.\n\nA recording of Jupiter&#8217;s whistlers can be heard here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=irsNtth5Cnk',

      content:
        'Jupiter&#8217;s Great Red Spot is the greatest storm in the solar system &#8211; but for how long?\n\nThe GRS is at its smallest observed size, and scientists aren&#8217;t sure why. As a Jovian fan, I&#8217;ve been using Slooh&#8217;s telescopes to track the GRS since I joined in 2004, and it&#8217;s been noticeable how the GRS has changed both colour and size over that time. These changes have even been visible from year-to-year and during a single apparition (observing season) as my image montage above shows.\n\nHubble Space Telescope images of the storm from 2014 showed that it was 16,496-kilometres (10,250-miles) across, which is less than half the size of the storm in the late 1800s. At one point, scientists theorised that three planet Earths could fit inside the Great Red Spot, but today, only the width of one Earth could fit within the raging tempest.\n\nAs the spot diminishes in size and ferocity, its shrinkage rate appears to be accelerating. My Slooh images from 2012 show the storm&#8217;s &#8220;waistline&#8221; is reducing by 933-kilometres (580-miles) a year.\n\nOn July 10th 2017 the Juno spacecraft took its closest ever fly-by of the Great Red Spot &#8211; we may yet learn what drives this storm and possibly even be able to forecast its future!',

        'Even prehistoric humans knew the planet Jupiter, and they watched the brilliant “wandering star” move eastward around sky once every twelve years, roughly, as it outshine all the fixed stars and nearly all the other planets save for Venus. The Babylonians named it after their god Marduk. The Chinese called it the “wood star”. The ancient German tribes linked it to the mighty Norse god Thor. The Romans, of course, named it after Jupiter, the greatest god in their pantheon, and we still use this name today.\n\nBefore the invention of the telescope, even the most astute thinkers had no idea what Jupiter and the other wandering stars&#8211; Venus, Mercury, Mars, and Saturn&#8211; or the stars themselves were made of. Aristotle, the most influential thinker in the western world, reasoned that all heavenly bodies were made of a special, perfect substance called aether that only existed beyond the Earth. Aristotle’s word on so many subjects was revered, his declarations on the nature of the stars and planets were taken as law for 2,000 years.\n\nBut when Galileo turned the first telescope to the night sky in 1609, he cracked the mystery of Jupiter. It was not a blob of perfect shimmering celestial fluid. It was a world, with four tiny worlds revolving around it. Scientists have been filling in the details ever since.',

        'In Japanese Jupiter is known as “The Star of Wood” or “Mokusei”. The day of the week related to Jupiter is Mokuyobi, or Thursday. Now, many would say this would be due to Jupiter’s color being streaks of brown and yellow and orange — maybe even with the red spot looking like a knot in the wood.\n\nIn the night sky, however, Jupiter is a white gleam to the naked eye, and the Japanese name for Jupiter predates the technology sophisticated enough to see Jupiter’s true colors&#8230;\n\nInstead of looking to Jupiter’s pallet, we actually have to look more on tradition. In Japanese each day of the week deals in an element, of which wood and metal (or gold) are also brought into the mix. These elements also have associations to planets.\n\nFor instance Tuesday is Kayobi and it’s associated to fire which is then equated with Mars. Due to the naming scheme, this actually means that Tuesday is “Fire Day” instead of “Mars Day” but the association is still there. For Jupiter this is much the same, and it has natural forces paired with its image; spring, sunrise, fresh blooms and the direction of east. Thus Thursday becomes Mokuyobi all thanks to Mokusei.',

        'Though in our night sky Jupiter gleams white, it’s a very different story when you get up close. (Thanks Juno space craft, for your amazing up close and personal pictures! Just don’t get in Jupiter’s way while it’s driving, I think paparazzi can get in trouble for that.) Jupiter becomes a swirl of brown, white, yellow, orange, and of course, red (can’t have a great red spot without it). I’ve been told it looks like a marble, a Christmas tree ornament, sandalwood but…I think it tends to look like a pumpkin spice mocha mid-mixer!\n\nYou wouldn’t want to try and drink Jupiter, though. It’s variation in color comes from a mixture of chemicals within the gas giant that, when they meet the light of the sun, reflect their respective colors; they are certainly not edible! From Helium and hydrogen topped with clouds sporting ammonia crystals, to sulfur and phosphorus churning about, you’d be lucky just to survive a wave from a distance, let alone eat it.

      content:
        'In addition to its huge size, one of the features which makes the Great Red Spot so interesting for observers is its longevity. Unlike other storms on Jupiter, which rarely last longer than a few years, the Great Red Spot has been around for centuries. It has been studied continuously since 1830, and before that was observed from 1665 to 1713. However, that leaves a large gap between sightings, which raises the question of what happened during that time. Was the observational record poor, or were the older sightings actually of a completely different spot that vanished into Jupiter&#8217;s atmosphere? Galactic sleuths don&#8217;t yet have an answer. No matter its age, it&#8217;s still pretty impressive.',

It took the _Voyager 1_ space probe to confirm what we know now, that far from being solid, the Great Red Spot is a massive storm.

      content:
        'The Great Red Spot, Jupiter&#8217;s massive storm, is one of its most familiar features. However, it&#8217;s hardly alone in Jupiter&#8217;s turbulent atmosphere where smaller white or brown storms are always popping up and disappearing. Unlike the Great Red Spot, they aren&#8217;t honored with impressive names due to their shorter lives. In 1939, three large white cyclones were noticed in one of Jupiter&#8217;s bands.  Over the succeeding decades they persisted and moved closer and closer together until all three merged into one huge storm in 2000. The storm then changed color from white to bright red, something rarely seen in storms other than the Great Red Spot. Officially (and boringly) named Oval BA, it has earned the affectionate nickname Red Spot Jr. due to its color and size. In fact, the storm is growing rapidly, in recent years far exceeding the Earth in size, and catching up rapidly to its&#8221;great&#8221; cousin. If it keeps growing, we may soon be able to observe _two_ massive super storms on Jupiter!',

      content:
        'Jupiter&#8217;s Great Red Spot has been a fixture of the planet for centuries, long impressing  astronomers with its perseverance and majesty. However, the spot has actually been shrinking rather rapidly, decreasing from a diameter of 40,000 km in the early 1900s, to just about 25,000 km now. To put that into context, the Great Red Spot has decreased in size by an amount roughly equivalent to the diameter of the _entire Earth. _That&#8217;s a big loss for any storm! If the shrinking continues, the Great Red Spot may even become circular rather than oval, although it&#8217;s unlikely to disappear entirely, and may eventually regain its former size.',

      title: 'Why the Great Red Spot is Red',
      content:
        'Jupiter&#8217;s perennial storm, the Great Red Spot, has fascinated many of us with its beautiful hue for hundreds of years. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t know exactly what gives the spot its unique color, the Great Red Spot isn’t even always red. Its color varies greatly with time, from the characteristic deep red, to orange, light pinkish and even white. The Spot has even vanished from view at times, blending in with the bands in Jupiter&#8217;s atmosphere. We’re only able to tell it’s still there because the atmospheric disturbances around the storm still remain. There are a number of theories for the culprit behind the red color, including molecules present in the storm interacting, such as ammonium hydrosulfide, phosphorus, or complex organic molecules exposed to sunlight, but none is an obvious candidate. Even though we may not know the secret behind the Great Red Spot, the results are indisputably beautiful, a true wonder of the Solar System!',
