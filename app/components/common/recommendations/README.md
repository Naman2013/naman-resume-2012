# Recommendations

This set of components is designed to handle inline Slooh Recommendation mission
reservations.  This will handle both the display and the reservation flow.

To use this, you need a set of AstroObject ID's as a collection - and it will handle the rest.

This component handles both the horizontal or vertical display of possible reservations.
