# RA and DEC calculations

To understand how the coordinate calculator is to function we need to understand
the underlying equations.


## RA: Right Ascension
---

Right ascension is the equivalent of longitude on Earth, but is measured differently.  On Earth longitude goes from -180 to +180, covering 360º all the way around.  Right ascension is measured in hours, each hour is equal to 15 degrees, so all the way around is 24 hours (15 x 24 = 360).  This means if you look up at a fixed point, it takes 1 hour of time for 1 hour of right ascension to go by in the sky.  Each hour of right ascension is also broken down into minutes and seconds, but since an hour of right ascension is 15 degrees, minutes and seconds of right ascension are normally bigger than minutes and seconds of declination (the exception is near the poles where the right ascension gets squashed down really small, like longitude on Earth).

Right ascension is normally expressed in hours, minutes and seconds, but because it runs 0 to 24, no sign or hemisphere is needed.  Such as:  16h 56m 27s   Note that ' and ” are replaced with m & s to note that these minutes and seconds are not the same size as minutes and seconds of declination.  This can also be expressed in decimal hours, like: 16.94083 hours.


## Dec: Declination

Declination is the equivalent of latitude on Earth.  It is measured the same - in degrees from +90 at the north celestial pole to -90 at the south.  Each degree can be divided into 60 minutes and each minute into 60 seconds.  These are minutes and second of arc and have no relation to the same terms used to measure time.

Normally, declination is expressed in degrees, minutes and seconds, with a hemisphere for North or South.  Such as:  34º 23' 14" N   Note that ' and ” are used to indicate minutes and seconds.  This can also be expressed in decimal degrees, where a sign replaces the hemisphere, like:  +34.38722 degrees.
