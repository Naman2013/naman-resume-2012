          Washington Depot, CT - On Monday, April 17<sup>th</sup>,
          Slooh, the only company to bring live celestial viewings to anybody
          with an internet connection, will launch a new version of its innovative
          technology. Slooh provides social viewing and control of robotic
          telescopes situated at world class observatory sites, including seven
          telescopes situated at its flagship observatory, at the Institute of
          Astrophysics of the Canary Islands, one of the world’s top observatory
          sites, and three telescopes based in Santiago, Chile, situated at the
          Catholic University and offering complementary views of the southern
          skies.
        </p>

        <p>
          &quot;The Slooh community is founded upon the principle that
          telescopes are more interesting and affordable as a shared, social
          experience with other people&quot; said Michael Paolucci, Founder and
          CEO of Slooh. When a member is in control of a Slooh telescope, all of
          the other members are able to watch, learn and capture images. The new
          version of Slooh.com builds on this by letting members of the community
          make posts in &#39;Community Perspectives&#39; about celestial objects
          that appear for all the other members to see whenever any of the
          telescopes are looking at that object. Slooh curates these posts, and
          true to its mission, welcomes diverse perspectives about what is
          &#39;out there&#39;, knowing that no one interpretation can ever be
          definitive.  Slooh is open to the spiritual, the artistic, the
          imaginative, along with the scientific. All posts are freely available
          to the public, who are invited to participate in the community as well.
        </p>

            night sky.

          </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          &quot;When you look through a Slooh telescope, you are doing it in
          unison with a global community looking up in wonder together. Therefore,
          we designed elements of this new experience to bring about an exchange
          of ideas, as we seek to curate our collective human response to space
          across every style of thought and expression&quot;, said Slooh
          Astronomer Paul Cox.
        </p>

        <p>
          Since its inception on December 25th, 2003, Slooh&#39;s membership
          community have operated its robotic telescopes continuously for 4,800
          nights, weather permitting. During that time, members have pointed the
          telescopes over one million times and taken over five million images of
          50,000+ unique objects in the sky. Members have made over 6,000
          submissions to the Minor Planet Center, tracked comets for JPL, been
          published in research with the Max Planck Institute, discovered and
          confirmed numerous supernova, nova, etc.
        </p>

        <p>
          Building on the success of its live video programming of eclipses,
          transits, full moons, asteroids, comets and other celestial phenomena,
          with an estimated reach of 50 million viewers since its inception in
          2009, the launch of the new website also includes the Space Situation
          Room, where Slooh will monitor and livestream all the happenings in
          space across a global network of telescopes, featuring more than 25
          partner observatories around the world. The Space Situation Room will
          be anchored by new host Gerard Monteux, also known as Bill Patrick, a
          long time host of NBC Sports, and Slooh Astronomers Paul Cox,
          Bob Berman and Eric Edelman and their guests.
